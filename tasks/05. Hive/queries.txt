1) Creating the table and downloading data into it

CREATE TABLE my_test (id INT, date_time TIMESTAMP, site_name INT, posa_continent INT, user_location_country INT, user_location_region INT, user_location_city INT, orig_destination_distance DOUBLE, user_id INT, is_mobile INT, is_package INT, channel INT, srch_ci STRING, srch_co STRING, srch_adults_cnt INT, srch_children_cnt INT, srch_rm_cnt INT, srch_destination_id INT, srch_destination_type_id INT, hotel_continent INT, hotel_country INT, hotel_market INT)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED by ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/admin/data/test.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE my_test;

2) Calculate 3 Top most popular countries
SELECT hotel_country FROM my_test
	WHERE is_mobile = 1
	GROUP BY hotel_country
    ORDER BY COUNT(hotel_country)
LIMIT 3;

4) Calculate 3 Top most popular hotels (treat hotel as composite key of continent, country and market)
SELECT hotel_continent, hotel_country, hotel_market FROM my_test
	WHERE is_mobile = 0
	GROUP BY hotel_continent, hotel_country, hotel_market
    ORDER BY COUNT(*)
LIMIT 3;
